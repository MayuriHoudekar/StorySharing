Usage ::

Open the project(InstagramStories) folder. You can find the Source folder inside.
Drag and drop Source folder into your project.
In your project use same IGStoryPreviewController.
But don't change default code what we wrote inside IGStoryPreviewController. You can add code on top of that.
Also don't change CollectionView's custom cell. Use the same IGStoryPreviewCell.
Because all the functionalities are handled in the IGStoryPreviewCell only.
If there is any issue or stuck somewhere on configuring Source folder on your project, please raise issues on github. We will reply back as soon as possible
